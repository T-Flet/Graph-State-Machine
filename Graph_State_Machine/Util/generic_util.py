## Higher-Order Functions

def foldq(f: Callable[[_b, _a], _b], g: Callable[[_b, _a, List[_a]], List[_a]], c: Callable[[_a], bool], xs: List[_a], acc: _b) -> Tuple[_b, List[_a]]:
    r'''
    Fold-like higher-order function where xs is traversed by consumption conditional on c and remaining xs are updated by g (therefore consumption order is not known a priori):
      - the first/next item to be ingested is the first in the remaining xs to fulfil condition c
      - at every x ingestion the item is removed from (a copy of) xs and all the remaining ones are potentially modified by function g
      - this function always returns a tuple of (acc, remaining_xs), unlike the stricter foldq_, which raises an exception for leftover xs
    Note: fold(f, xs, acc) == foldq(f, lambda acc, x, xs: xs, lambda x: True, xs, acc)
    Suitable names: consumption_fold, condition_update_fold, cu_fold, q_fold, qfold or foldq
    :param f: 'Traditional' fold function :: acc -> x -> acc
    :param g: 'Update' function for all remaining xs at every iteration :: acc -> x -> xs -> xs
    :param c: 'Condition' function to select the next x (first which satisfies it) :: x -> Bool
    :param xs: Structure to consume
    :param acc: Starting value for the accumulator
    :returns: (acc, remaining_xs)
